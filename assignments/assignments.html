    <!-- Assignment 1 (Partitions Assignment) -->
    <h2>Storage Volumes, Partitions and FileSystems Assignment - 21/02/2025</h2>
    <img class="assignmentPic" src="assignmentPics/partitioning.png">
    <div class="assignmentDescrip">
        <p> 
            <b>Description: </b>This assignment involves creating and managing disk 
            partitions on both a computer and a USB flash drive. Students will shrink 
            their main hard drive to create unallocated space, then format it into NTFS, 
            FAT32, and Ext4 partitions with specific labels and sizes. They will also 
            partition a flash drive into three sections with different file systems, 
            observe which are visible on Windows, and explain why. Finally, all flash 
            drive partitions will be deleted and replaced with a single NTFS partition. 
            Screenshots and explanations are required throughout to demonstrate the steps 
            and tools used.

    <!-- Assignment 2 (Motherboard Assignment) -->
    <h2>The CPU and MB Assignment - 28/02/2025</h2>
    <img class="assignmentPic" src="assignmentPics/cpu.png">
    <div class="assignmentDescrip">
        <p> 
            <b>Description: </b>This assignment helped us understand how to research CPUâ€™s and motherboards 
            so that we can make an informed decision when it comes to choosing either an 
            AMD or Intel processor. We will use this information to determine which 
            manufacturer has the best value for a mid level and also a high end computer.
            Additionally, this assignment helped us better understand motherboards and all 
            their components.

    <!-- Assignment 3 (Cisco Assignment) -->
    <h2>Cisco Packet Tracer Assignment - 28/03/2025</h2>
    <img class="assignmentPic" src="assignmentPics/cisco.png">
    <div class="assignmentDescrip">
        <p> 
            <b>Description: </b>In this assignment, students will work in groups to design, 
            configure, and test a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network must consist 
            of four LANs, each with its own switch, DHCP server, and a unique layout (top, 
            bottom, left, right). The top LAN must also run a DNS server used by all computers 
            across the network, and each server must host a uniquely labeled webpage. Students 
            will demonstrate full connectivity, domain resolution, DHCP functionality, and 
            inter-device communication, supported by screenshots and analysis. The assignment 
            ends with a bonus wireless setup and submission of working PKT and PKZ files.

    <!-- Assignment 4 (Programming Assignment) -->
    <h2>Arduino C++ Programming Summative - 16/04/2025</h2>
    <img class="assignmentPic" src="assignmentPics/programming.png">
    <div class="assignmentDescrip">
        <p> 
            <b>Description: </b>For this project, we will create a computer game. It is recommended that we 
            use an existing game as the basis for your program. We may also create our own game, but this 
            option has the added responsibility of (a) the creative process to make a reasonable game, and 
            (b) producing documentation for the game itself.

    <!-- Assignment 5 (Vex Assignment) -->
    <h2>Vex Robotics Assignment - 16/04/2025</h2>
    <img class="assignmentPic" src="assignmentPics/vex.png">
    <div class="assignmentDescrip">
        <p> 
            <b>Description: </b>In this project, students will program a VEX EDR Clawbot 
            to complete two tasks: navigate a custom obstacle course and transport an 
            object from one location to another. An optional third challenge can be added 
            with teacher approval. Students must create a website showcasing the robot's 
            tasks, including a visual path map, embedded videos, and fully documented code. 
            The project encourages creativity, modification of sensors, and thoughtful 
            design, and is graded based on application, communication, and technical inquiry.
