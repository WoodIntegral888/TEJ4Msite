    <h2>The CPU and MB Assignment - 28/02/2025</h2>
    <p> <b>Description: </b>This assignment helped us understand how to research CPUâ€™s and motherboards 
        so that we can make an informed decision when it comes to choosing either an 
        AMD or Intel processor. We will use this information to determine which 
        manufacturer has the best value for a mid level and also a high end computer.
        Additionally, this assignment helped us better understand motherboards and all 
        their components.</p>

    <h2>Arduino C++ Programming Summative - 16/04/2025</h2>
    <p> <b>Description: </b>For this project, we will create a computer game. It is recommended that we 
        use an existing game as the basis for your program. We may also create our own game, but this 
        option has the added responsibility of (a) the creative process to make a reasonable game, and 
        (b) producing documentation for the game itself.
